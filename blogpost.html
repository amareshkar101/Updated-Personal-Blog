        <i>By Brooke Steele, current Udacity Student</i>
<p>When I first started my Udacity journey, I could barely read through a page of code. Now, I am creating my own web pages! When I'm not working of Front-End I can be found teaching violin in Seattle, WA.</p>

            <h4>June 15, 2020 by Brooke</h4>
            <p><em>It's understandable why most people might have anxiety about flying during a pandemic. However, this doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice those vacation days you requested months ago. Road trips are a great low risk travel option and provide dozens of opportunities to see amazing American landmarks.</em></p>

            <h2><b>Flight Attendant Themed Dinner</b></h2>
            <h4>May 19, 2020 by Brooke</h4>
           <p><em> I was watching "The Tonight Show" not to long ago where guest star Tina Fey explained to the virtual audience how she is keeping her two young daughters entertained during quarentine. She helps them create theme dinners, where they decorate the house, dress up, and cook a meal to that theme. The comedian brought a tape of her youngest daughter dressed like a flight attendant to hand out dinner to the rest of her family.</p>
     <p>"The nice thing about it is that it takes a lot of time to prepare these dinners" Fey explained. Perfect for kids on Spring Break or parents who want to have a fun night with the family.</em></p>
